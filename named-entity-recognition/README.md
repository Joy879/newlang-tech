# Building Named Entity Recognition for New Languages

Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of recognizing named entities such as people, places, and organizations. It is useful if you want to analyze text in many cases.

## Collecting Data

There are some sources for labeled NER data that can be used to train systems. 

* [WikiAnn Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikiann): A broad corpus automatically created from data from Wikipedia.
* [MasakhaNER Corpus](https://github.com/masakhane-io/masakhane-ner): A corpus of NER data from African languages.

## Creating Data

You can also create data yourself if it doesn't exist.

TODO: A good procedure to do this should be filled in.

## Improving on Your System

TODO: Once you have a system, how can you improve it.
