# Building Speech Synthesis for New Languages

Speech synthesis is the task of generating speech from text. It is useful if you want to build a speech interface.

## Collecting Data

There are many sources for speech data that can be used to train systems. It'd be a good idea to take a look here to see if there is data that you can use.

* [CMU Wilderness Corpus](https://github.com/festvox/datasets-CMU_Wilderness): This is a very broad corpus with 699 languages.

## Creating Data

You can also create data yourself if it doesn't exist.

TODO: A good procedure to do this should be filled in.
